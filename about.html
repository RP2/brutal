            <p>Basically I wanted to see if I could design a website that goes against everything I have learned so far. You are told there are rules in design and that breaking these will cause issues for the audience. An obvious example would be using a dark color with another dark color, 90% of the time this will cause visibility issues, especially for print media.</p>
            <p>There is also a belief that things need to be polished to look nice, as if rough edges to a design aren't acceptible anymore. We can easily see this in vehicle design over the years. Older cars from the 80s have sharp edges and are more box like which to me is a much nicer aesthetic to today's car design where they try and make everything look organic and smooth.</p>
